Why put on Google AdSense when you can sell backlinks to eager Digital Marketers who want backlink for thier clients? Well because it goes against Google's SEO policies..


This platform will allow you to become the middle man  in backlink exchanges. Connect your PAYPAL crudentials and reach out to webmasters who want to sell backlinks. Payouts are determined based on the link being up 90% of the time. This platform will check the link everyday to make sure it is still on the site.
